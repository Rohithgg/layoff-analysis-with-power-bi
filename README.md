# Layoff Analysis
## Overview
In this repository, we analyze the impact of recent layoffs within our organization. The goal is to understand the reasons behind the layoffs, their effects on employees, and potential implications for the company moving forward.

## Data source
the data is from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022]

## Analysis
Outline the steps taken during the analysis:

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format data.
Explore the dataset to identify trends and patterns.
By this we can make our work more frctionless and handle NULL errors.
